/**You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
Example 2:

Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 45
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
function climbStairs(n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;

    let oneStepBefore = 2; // ways to reach step 2
    let twoStepsBefore = 1; // ways to reach step 1
    let allWays = 0;

    for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        allWays = oneStepBefore + twoStepsBefore;
        twoStepsBefore = oneStepBefore;
        oneStepBefore = allWays;
    }

    return allWays;
